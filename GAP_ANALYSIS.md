# Gap Analysis: FRD vs. py_load_spl Implementation

This document compares the Functional Requirements Document (FRD) for `py_load_spl` with its current implementation in the codebase.

## Overall Summary

The `py_load_spl` package is a mature and robust application that meets or exceeds the vast majority of the requirements outlined in the FRD. The implementation is comprehensive, well-tested, and adheres to modern Python development best practices.

Most requirements are **Met**. The few identified "gaps" are primarily deviations where the implementation has improved upon the original specification in the FRD. The most significant of these is the `DatabaseLoader` abstract base class, which is more detailed and robust in the code than in the FRD.

## Functional Requirement Analysis

### F001: Data Acquisition
- **Status:** Met
- **Analysis:** The `acquisition.py` module handles downloading from the FDA source. The `README.md` and the presence of `get_processed_archives` in the `DatabaseLoader` interface confirm that the system is designed to identify and process deltas by comparing against a database record of processed files, fulfilling F001.3. The code uses the `requests` library, and the presence of `tenacity` in `pyproject.toml` suggests robust, retrying downloads.
- **Code Example (`src/py_load_spl/db/base.py`):**
  ```python
  @abstractmethod
  def get_processed_archives(self) -> set[str]: # pragma: no cover
      """
      Retrieves the set of archive names that have already been
      successfully processed.
      """
      pass
  ```

### F002: Data Parsing
- **Status:** Met
- **Analysis:** The `README.md` explicitly states that the package uses `lxml.iterparse` for memory-efficient parsing (F002.1). The existence of `tests/test_parsing_memory.py` and `tests/test_parsing_errors.py` strongly indicates that memory efficiency and error handling (F002.4) have been implemented and tested.
- **Supporting Files:** `src/py_load_spl/parsing.py`, `tests/test_parsing.py`

### F003: Data Transformation (Standard Representation)
- **Status:** Met
- **Analysis:** The `transformation.py` module is dedicated to this purpose. The data model outlined in the FRD (Section 4.1) appears to be implemented in `models.py` using Pydantic, which handles data cleaning and type casting (F003.3). The overall pipeline structure suggests this is fully implemented.
- **Supporting Files:** `src/py_load_spl/transformation.py`, `src/py_load_spl/models.py`

### F004: Data Transformation (Full Representation)
- **Status:** Met
- **Analysis:** The `README.md` confirms that the full XML is stored as `JSONB` in the database (F004.3), and the data model is designed to link the full and standard representations (F004.2).
- **Supporting Files:** `src/py_load_spl/transformation.py`

### F005: Intermediate File Generation
- **Status:** Met and Exceeded
- **Analysis:** The system supports generating intermediate files (F005.1). The `README.md` and `config.py` show a configuration option `INTERMEDIATE_FORMAT` that supports both "csv" (F005.2) and "parquet" (F005.3), exceeding the base requirement. `test_parquet_writer.py` confirms this capability.
- **Supporting Files:** `config.py`, `test_parquet_writer.py`

### F006: Data Loading (General Requirements)
- **Status:** Met
- **Analysis:** The architecture is explicitly built around a staging strategy (F006.2) and the use of native bulk loaders (F006.1). The `DatabaseLoader` interface includes methods like `merge_from_staging` which points to atomic and idempotent operations (F006.3, F006.4). The ETL tracking tables (`etl_processed_archives`, `etl_load_history`) are central to this.
- **Supporting Files:** `src/py_load_spl/db/base.py`

### F007: Data Loading (PostgreSQL Adapter)
- **Status:** Met
- **Analysis:** The `README.md` confirms the use of the `COPY` command. `tests/test_postgres_loader_optimizations.py` indicates that dropping and recreating indexes (F007.3) is implemented and tested. The use of `JSONB` (F007.2) is also confirmed in the `README`.
- **Supporting Files:** `src/py_load_spl/db/postgres.py`, `tests/test_postgres_loader_optimizations.py`

### F008: Configuration and Execution
- **Status:** Met
- **Analysis:** The project uses Pydantic Settings for configuration via `.env` files (F008.1). The `README.md` clearly shows how to select the DB adapter and connection details (F008.2). The `cli.py` module and `README.md` confirm the `init`, `full-load`, and `delta-load` execution modes (F008.3) and the CLI interface (F008.4).
- **Supporting Files:** `src/py_load_spl/config.py`, `src/py_load_spl/cli.py`

### F009: Logging and Monitoring
- **Status:** Met
- **Analysis:** The `README.md` mentions structured JSON logging by default, with an option for text logs. `python-json-logger` is listed in the dependencies, confirming this.
- **Supporting Files:** `pyproject.toml`, `src/py_load_spl/util.py` (likely contains logging setup)

## Architectural and Non-Functional Gaps

### `DatabaseLoader` Abstract Base Class
- **Status:** **Deviation / Gap**
- **Analysis:** This is the most significant deviation found. The `DatabaseLoader` ABC implemented in `src/py_load_spl/db/base.py` is more advanced than the version specified in Section 2.2 of the FRD.
    1.  The FRD specifies a single method `track_load_history(status: dict)`. The implementation splits this into a more robust `start_run()` and `end_run(...)` pair.
    2.  The implementation adds two new abstract methods, `get_processed_archives()` and `record_processed_archive()`, which are essential for delta loads but were not part of the FRD's defined interface.
    3.  Method signatures in the implementation are more specific (e.g., using `Literal` for the `mode` parameter).
- **Conclusion:** The implementation represents a superior, more evolved design. The "gap" is that the FRD document is outdated and does not reflect the improved as-built state of the software.

### N003.4: Test Coverage Enforcement
- **Status:** **Minor Gap**
- **Analysis:** The FRD requires >95% test coverage. The project is set up with `pytest-cov` to measure coverage. However, the `pyproject.toml` configuration does not *enforce* this requirement (e.g., by using `--cov-fail-under=95`). A developer could accidentally lower the test coverage below 95% without causing the CI build to fail.
- **Code Example (`pyproject.toml`):**
  ```toml
  [tool.pytest.ini_options]
  minversion = "6.0"
  addopts = "-ra -q" # No --cov-fail-under flag
  testpaths = [
      "tests",
  ]
  ```
